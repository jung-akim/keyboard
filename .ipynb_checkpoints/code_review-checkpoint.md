### Pythonic Code: 5/5
*Code should generally follow [Pep-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) guidelines* <br/>
*Avoiding use of nested loops and redundant data structures* <br/>

- Well written code. I'm hard pressed to find very much to gripe about from a syntax standpoint. If I had to gripe I'd say you have a few empty cells lying around that you could delete. Additionally, you could go through and capitalize the remainder of markdown comments. 

### Well Documented Code: 4/5 
*Markdown cells are used appropriately to define and describe sections* <br/>
*Visualizations are easy to follow and add value* <br/>

- Great visualizations. I love your EDA file, feature engineering, modeling plots, etc. 
- You could document a little bit more about the analysis process. The cleaning is great. It's also pretty straight forward. I did this...then this...then this. Analysis documentation should read more like a story. Why did you decide to run these histograms? What are they telling you? What are the residuals telling you? Is there anything off about your statsmodels summary? What did you do next?

### Reproducible Code: 5/5
*Variable names are descriptive* <br/>
*Use functions if you perform an action more than once* <br/>

- Easy to follow, and it looks like I can just download the notebooks and press 'run all' and get the same results, which is the definition of reproducibility. Good work.

### General Comments:

- I'm very impressed with the statistical methods you've used, and the rigor in applying them. 
- In future, you may want to consider cleaning up the submission by adding a data/ sub-folder
